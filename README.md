# Automated Randotracker

(Work in progress)

An automated tracker for the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Randomizer. It runs a local server on your computer, and connecting to it with a web browser will display a list of all the places and items you need. You don't need to tick them, since it detects automatically the places you've been and the things you've taken.
